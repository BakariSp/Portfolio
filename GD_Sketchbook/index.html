How do you develop your collection of city parts based on personal interest, feedback, and new inspiration/critical frameworks from readings/discussion? What is the work plan that you set yourself? You might have to plan more excursions to collect new materials and/or give yourself an assignment to, say, generate ten drawing variations based around a theme. </p>

                Hyperreality?
                Modern reality as a highly compressed world.

            <h3>2. What are the (design) questions implied by your project?</h3>
            <div>
                Can we restore the modern reality to the 4-dimensional hyperreality?
                What is the simulation and simlacral content in our surrounding world?

            <h3>4. After considering the learning objectives for this project —</h3>
            <pre>
                ○ Translate observations into design criteria, prototypes or artifacts
                ○ Formulate and integrate critical reflection as part of a practice
                ○ Conduct research through formal and conceptual analysis
                ○ Define and refine research insights and goals
                ○ Design, and refine formal craft
                ○ Use iterative design methodology
                ○ Employ formal descriptions and terminology when speaking about design
                ○ Craft with care, consideration, quality and attention to detail
                — what's your work plan for next week?
            </pre>
               
        
            
        
            <div>
                It is inspired by Burdrillard concepts of simulation and simulacra, My topic last week is about projection, and I claimed that our worldview works as a kind of projection. Last week all I thought about was how to create a projection of our world, and compress it into a 2-dimensional graph, we talked about the shadow is a projection of reality, and the shape and value of the shadow depend on the angles of the lights, the project object and the texture of the ground. 
            </div>
            <div>
                However, after reading Baudrillard's article, it comes to my mind that, our reality is not so real, our observations which we think are by our own eyes, have already been defined by other pieces of culture. What’s more, this process happens faster than our self-consciousness, it’s so fast that we even cannot realize it until we found we are deeply influenced by that.
            </div>
            <div>
                So I want to do some disassembly analysis of our world, the unreliable reality. Constructing the world model by restoring the history and cultural content into it. Those brands, logos, signs, styles of architecture and the image of our culture all contain an immense amount of culture, so I just think can I build a model of a 4-dimensional world of culture, history, and time?
            </div>
            <div>
                City-community? Choose a community, social group, region?
                What dose compression means?
                Technique? Approaches?
